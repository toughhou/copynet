What?When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?Oh God! He killed them!
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.It's no story. It happened. Freddy's real and he's back.
I'll tell you later.It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.It's okay, babe. We're with you.
It's okay, babe. We're with you.I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Feeling better now?Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?You had a nasty bump.
I gotta get out of here.You just stay put. You need rest.
You just stay put. You need rest.You don't get it, he's after me...
You don't get it, he's after me...Don't worry, honey
Excuse us, dear.It's okay, Dan
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.And ours. It's our grandchild.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --What are you talking about? My "condition"?...
Hey...wake up.Huh?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?It's lonely in there, in my room.
It's lonely in there, in my room.My name is...
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?Been having bad dreams.
Is that who you're waiting for?No...
Who says I don't like you?My friend, with the funny hand.
Mommy...?Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Where is he?He's inside you, where he hides.
What do you mean?It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.
But how...?He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.
Hi, beautiful.Jesus! Don't do that!
Jesus! Don't do that!Sorry, babe.
Okay, babe. What's the matter?Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.He'll show up. C'mon, what's really wrong?
You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.Yeah...I guess.
Yeah...I guess.You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...You're right.
You're right.There you go. Love you.
There you go. Love you.Me too.
That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.No. A deal's a deal.
Where are we going?To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad.You sure you don't want a ride to work?
You sure you don't want a ride to work?It's just across the park.
I'm so sorry, honey...Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back. Make them understand.
How was the meeting?Sobering...
Sobering...Very funny.
Very funny.Alice...
Alice...Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?Since my little girl became a mom...
Since my little girl became a mom...You disappointed in me?
Alice!I've got to go.
But Dad --Now.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.Had kind of a long night.
Had kind of a long night.Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.No, the Dan part was nice...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Did everyone call everyone?They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
What's that got to do with it?When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.
It was just an accident. Like with Dan.No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...That's the only reason you're alive...
Are you alright?Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.
You think that's the place she's buried?If they actually bothered to bury her.
What?Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
You do good work, Alice.So did Dan.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.I think I'm starting to wear her down. Have some anyway.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.Greta, come on. One burger with me?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.Well we gotta do something!
I've got to write some of this down.That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark, are you okay?Yeah. I'm just aces.
I thought about that.She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Then get out!Mark!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?Nobody thinks that.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.Why don't I go make some coffee. There's a lot to tell.
Who's Jacob?My baby!
My baby!What, you named it already?
Where are you going?I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.Then we'll find another way.
They think I'm nuts.That's their problem.
They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.But I've seen her grave.
But I've seen her grave.Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
Poor woman...No shit.
I don't understand.She killed herself. Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?Next life. Oh, what's that?
Next life. Oh, what's that?My undying love. Have some.
Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.Who?
These things are wild... What do you think?Makes you look like a nun--
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.I want to talk about the baby.
Vomit?Faint.
It's okay.Stick around, please?
You, too?He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.How is he - ?
What is it?Your 'out.' This came for you.
Your 'out.' This came for you.My father! He's not - ?
My father! He's not - ?Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Unidentified Flying Objects.Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Yes?Which is the one - we have to worry about?
But if they <u>do</u>?I don't know.
Reef!So they caught up with you, too?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!Huh?
Huh?I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?I guess.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?'His' side? I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
We're stuck tight!Skipper! Look at the depth gauge!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --'Us?'
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
I think you're right.Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Yeah?Listen! Hear that?
Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!You know - it <u>is</u>?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
You hear that?The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?Somewhere down there?
Somewhere down there?Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?We'll have to look for them later.
Well?I'm with <u>you!</u>
Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.Oh it does???
Dave - !What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.Right, Skipper.
Is there any way out of it?Seems to be all around...
Seems to be all around...What about down?
What about down?I...don't know!
Course and speed?Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!What???
What course, Skipper?Right at our one-eyed friend!
You better take Powell and Carney with you --The frogmen?
The frogmen?With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.We hope!
Excuse me, Skipper---Yes, Griff?
Yes, Griff?All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?Something wrong?
Something wrong?The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!What????
Now they feel it...down below.Radiation level...constantly rising...
Under <u>water</u>?High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged. And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
...above Murmansk, and Finland.Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!What direction does the system indicate?
As we near the Pole...There's got to be an explanation!
There's got to be an explanation!There is. I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
All ready?As ready as we <u>can</u> be! I'll report to the Skipper.
Who with?Dr. Neilsen. He'll be - -
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?Huh?
Huh?It'll be all right. We're old friends!
What do you think?I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.After torpedo room: Report!
You're sure it's Cyclops?Take a look.
What's the running time?Thirty-four seconds!
Right <u>at</u> him?That's what I said!
That's what I said!But - what can we accomplish?
But - what can we accomplish?We can <u>ram</u> him!
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?What?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!Nothing we can do, now.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?Minus three.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!Come where?
Swell!Your friend was to remain where he was!
He did!I am afraid not. Therefore -
Why not me? What am I - the closing act?On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.Why?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?Of course. But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?Obviously.
Obviously.<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.Thank you.
Well, I'll be - !I'll be another!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Due north. At five knots...no, six!Toward the Pole!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.All right - go to it.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?

I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.Give her time. Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.Enough of that crap.
Enough of that crap.I saw it. It was my dream. I brought Sheila in...
T-T-Thanks Alice...Earth to Alice...
Hey, Rick!Excuse me, ladies. I'll just be a moment.
I don't get it.Let me talk to you.
Hey man, we're all sorry...She knew she was gonna die.
Been up with Alice.How she doing? I ran into her last night.
What's wrong with me?Your distraught. It'll help...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.Mother, you've just murdered me. Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Something wrong with the stairs?Avoid-all-contact-day.
Avoid-all-contact-day.What?
What?When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?Oh God! He killed them!
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.It's no story. It happened. Freddy's real and he's back.
I'll tell you later.It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.It's okay, babe. We're with you.
It's okay, babe. We're with you.I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Feeling better now?Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?You had a nasty bump.
I gotta get out of here.You just stay put. You need rest.
You just stay put. You need rest.You don't get it, he's after me...
You don't get it, he's after me...Don't worry, honey
Excuse us, dear.It's okay, Dan
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.And ours. It's our grandchild.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --What are you talking about? My "condition"?...
Hey...wake up.Huh?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?It's lonely in there, in my room.
It's lonely in there, in my room.My name is...
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?Been having bad dreams.
Is that who you're waiting for?No...
Who says I don't like you?My friend, with the funny hand.
Mommy...?Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Where is he?He's inside you, where he hides.
What do you mean?It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.
But how...?He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.
Hi, beautiful.Jesus! Don't do that!
Jesus! Don't do that!Sorry, babe.
Okay, babe. What's the matter?Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.He'll show up. C'mon, what's really wrong?
You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.Yeah...I guess.
Yeah...I guess.You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...You're right.
You're right.There you go. Love you.
There you go. Love you.Me too.
That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.No. A deal's a deal.
Where are we going?To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad.You sure you don't want a ride to work?
You sure you don't want a ride to work?It's just across the park.
I'm so sorry, honey...Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back. Make them understand.
How was the meeting?Sobering...
Sobering...Very funny.
Very funny.Alice...
Alice...Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?Since my little girl became a mom...
Since my little girl became a mom...You disappointed in me?
Alice!I've got to go.
But Dad --Now.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.Had kind of a long night.
Had kind of a long night.Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.No, the Dan part was nice...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Did everyone call everyone?They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
What's that got to do with it?When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.
It was just an accident. Like with Dan.No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...That's the only reason you're alive...
Are you alright?Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.
You think that's the place she's buried?If they actually bothered to bury her.
What?Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
You do good work, Alice.So did Dan.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.I think I'm starting to wear her down. Have some anyway.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.Greta, come on. One burger with me?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.Well we gotta do something!
I've got to write some of this down.That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark, are you okay?Yeah. I'm just aces.
I thought about that.She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Then get out!Mark!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?Nobody thinks that.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.Why don't I go make some coffee. There's a lot to tell.
Who's Jacob?My baby!
My baby!What, you named it already?
Where are you going?I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.Then we'll find another way.
They think I'm nuts.That's their problem.
They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.But I've seen her grave.
But I've seen her grave.Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
Poor woman...No shit.
I don't understand.She killed herself. Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?Next life. Oh, what's that?
Next life. Oh, what's that?My undying love. Have some.
Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.Who?
These things are wild... What do you think?Makes you look like a nun--
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.I want to talk about the baby.
Vomit?Faint.
It's okay.Stick around, please?
You, too?He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.How is he - ?
What is it?Your 'out.' This came for you.
Your 'out.' This came for you.My father! He's not - ?
My father! He's not - ?Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Unidentified Flying Objects.Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Yes?Which is the one - we have to worry about?
But if they <u>do</u>?I don't know.
Reef!So they caught up with you, too?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!Huh?
Huh?I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?I guess.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?'His' side? I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
We're stuck tight!Skipper! Look at the depth gauge!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --'Us?'
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
I think you're right.Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Yeah?Listen! Hear that?
Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!You know - it <u>is</u>?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
You hear that?The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?Somewhere down there?
Somewhere down there?Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?We'll have to look for them later.
Well?I'm with <u>you!</u>
Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.Oh it does???
Dave - !What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.Right, Skipper.
Is there any way out of it?Seems to be all around...
Seems to be all around...What about down?
What about down?I...don't know!
Course and speed?Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!What???
What course, Skipper?Right at our one-eyed friend!
You better take Powell and Carney with you --The frogmen?
The frogmen?With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.We hope!
Excuse me, Skipper---Yes, Griff?
Yes, Griff?All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?Something wrong?
Something wrong?The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!What????
Now they feel it...down below.Radiation level...constantly rising...
Under <u>water</u>?High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged. And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
...above Murmansk, and Finland.Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!What direction does the system indicate?
As we near the Pole...There's got to be an explanation!
There's got to be an explanation!There is. I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
All ready?As ready as we <u>can</u> be! I'll report to the Skipper.
Who with?Dr. Neilsen. He'll be - -
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?Huh?
Huh?It'll be all right. We're old friends!
What do you think?I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.After torpedo room: Report!
You're sure it's Cyclops?Take a look.
What's the running time?Thirty-four seconds!
Right <u>at</u> him?That's what I said!
That's what I said!But - what can we accomplish?
But - what can we accomplish?We can <u>ram</u> him!
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?What?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!Nothing we can do, now.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?Minus three.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!Come where?
Swell!Your friend was to remain where he was!
He did!I am afraid not. Therefore -
Why not me? What am I - the closing act?On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.Why?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?Of course. But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?Obviously.
Obviously.<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.Thank you.
Well, I'll be - !I'll be another!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Due north. At five knots...no, six!Toward the Pole!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.All right - go to it.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?

My father always wanted a boy.Really? I fail to see the connection.
Really? I fail to see the connection.I had a feeling you would. Touche!

I must say, you look more your old self --You mean my other self ...

I don't want to go --Fine.
Did -- did you --It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
What about Pike?Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
He is the only one unaccounted for.Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --Can anybody hear me!
Hey, I -- Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?We found him like this --
We got -- I don't know, we got separatedBefore or after the explosion? Mueller --
Before or after the explosion? Mueller --I don't know!
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.HEY!
West was one thing, but this --Shut up, Mueller.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion -- Where's Pike?We don't know. West is dead.
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --What do you mean, alone?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?We found him like this...
Yeah, right...Shut up. West's dead.
Why not?I asked for a policeman.
I asked for a policeman.You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?It's... too slow.
It's... too slow.Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.I just don't like it.
I just don't like it.What do you like then?
There's no need...They're dead, aren't they?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?I'm not telling you what happened.
Some.Tell me about them.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
That son of a bitch.That'd be my reaction too --
That'd be my reaction too --He's lying.
He's lying.Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --I'm serious --
I didn't shoot West --Yeah, we know, Pike did.
I apologize --You saw West's body.
You saw West's body.Of course --
And he'd been shot.Yeah --
You saved Kendall's life --But not Pike's.
We're not finished yet --You wanna bet?
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --Jesus!
He -- He made me do it --Do what?
Do what?Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
And the bodies?You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...He's telling the truth up to a point...
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.There were six of us...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?Epilepsy.
He said he worked there --No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?What business?
Where?The creek bed --
Back up.Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?Yeah.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?Would you have believed me?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...How do you know that?
Cadet, what's your name!Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
What the fuck is going on?Your weapons, Sergeant.
He wouldn't kill anybody...Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Shut up. Let me see your grenades.Why?
Why?We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Jesus, what happened?West... he's dead.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.So did we. Why didn't you come?
So you killed him?I...
Whose blood is that, Jay?West's. Any kindling for afire?
What do you mean, West's?I mean I killed him. Isn't that what we all wanted?
Roberto, what the fuck?We just want to check your pack --
We just want to check your pack --Why?
You know it's not like that --Do I?
Right?Yeah...
You gotta untie me. I didn't do this thing, Ray.You hated West more than any of us.
You hated West more than any of us.Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --You're the only one missing a grenade.
If not you, then who?Mueller.
Mueller.Oh, come on --
That's exactly what he says about you.Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
You hated West, Mueller loved him --Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --Bullshit.
Bullshit.Look in my pack.
Look in my pack.Why?
Why?Just look. Little pocket.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.You're lying --
You're lying --Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.You saw West, right? How was he killed?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?Full clip to the body --
Full clip to the body --From up close or far away?
From up close or far away?His chest was hamburger --
I... I don't know...What don't you know?
What don't you know?This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --Put it down!
I've done nothing wrong. I'm the victim here.But not the only victim, right?
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.What happened to "degrees"?
What happened to "degrees"?I didn't kill him --
I didn't kill him --Then who did?
But you didn't.No. Poetic justice, though.
He admitted it.Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.Mr. Hardy?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --Stop.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"Well?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --I didn't do anything --
Why?Because of what I saw. Who really killed West.
How do you know?Because I was standing next to him.
I didn't --But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
I don't know --Where are they!
Where are they!Maybe --
Maybe --MAYBE WHAT --
MAYBE WHAT --Maybe he...
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.Who killed Pike?
Who killed Pike?Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Nevertheless --Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.Not for me.
You mean not enough to save you.JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Tom, where are you going --Home, I'm done.
Home, I'm done.What about the confession?
What I said before --Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?Yeah.
Yeah.Does Osborne agree?
That's horseshit and you know it.Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
They're taking your command, aren't they?The Senator...
I'm sorry, Bill.Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.You're a good soldier, Bill.
You're a good soldier, Bill.I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
You're drunk --I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Stay where you are.Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --Get your hands away from the desk!
Hostile and uncooperative.Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Ah, ChristYou knew Sergeant West?
You knew Sergeant West?He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --You and the Colonel go back.
You and the Colonel go back.He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
He's in interrogation?Yes.
Yes.Move him.
Move him.Why?
Excuse me?Is Dunbar cute?
Is Dunbar cute?That is the most unprofessional --
Good cop/bad cop?Something like that.
Baseball?I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --You made me look like an idiot --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?You're right. We should sit in silence.
You're right. We should sit in silence.We're in the middle of a murder case --
We're in the middle of a murder case --Best time for banal chit-chat.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.Something like that. You?
Something like that. You?I lost a bet.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?The very same.
I plan to grow on you.You're off to a late start.
You're off to a late start.So noted.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.What point?
Something wrong?Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.Not the happiest of memories?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.Got it.
That was kid gloves?Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
But we have to question him -- Thought you didn't have cigarettes --I lied. Wait for it...
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?I don't think that has anything to do with --
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?I don't know.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --Watch me.
Watch me.You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
I didn't shoot West...What?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.What happened next?
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --Buttfucks the cabin?
That bugs you too?Little bit.
Little bit.Let's go talk to Bill...
We're fucked, I know --They got their stories straight.
They got their stories straight.What?
Are you sure?Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?Good idea.
I pushed him too hard.You couldn't have known --
You couldn't have known --Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.You wanted to get the truth.
You wanted to break him.Yeah.
Yeah.So did I.
So what now?Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.Think it'll work?
Think it'll work?Nah.
For what?That's gonna stay my secret.
No.Good, just making sure.
Four --Get in.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.Right back where we started.
Hardy, what are you doing --Isn't this how your story goes?
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
No bodies, no West...No death certificates. No crime.
We need to talk --Seven.
What if I don't want it?Tough.
That's not true.There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.You're a good man, Hardy.
You're a good man, Hardy.Really.
West?Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Do I have a choice in this?Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
What are you doing out here?Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.Think it'll work?
Think it'll work?Nah.
Nah.Want company?
I should probably write that down.Yeah.
Your phone number?In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
He was your friend.Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Pike, please --Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
Maybe we shouldn't go.The faggot speaks.
The faggot speaks.You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --Poor fucker my ass...
Pike and I got separated --Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --I remember now, it was before the explosion --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --Oh, you remember now --
Oh, you remember now --I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
I was freezing from the hurricane --So you took off your shirt?
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.He wanted more than that.
He said what?"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.No one else heard it?
No one else heard it?He whispered it in my ear.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.Because he'd shot Mueller.
Because he'd shot Mueller.But you didn't see it, right?
Pike never confessed.We've been making progress, I see.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --Wait --
Wait --What.
Dunbar's telling the truth.Wrong answer --
Who, Levi --Childs.
What happened with Nunez?He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
Thank God...What the fuck are you doing?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --Shut the fuck up. He was gonna cut him loose.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?I used it to start the fire --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --We're not going anywhere.
The fuck are you talking about --You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --Bullshit --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
So?Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
This is totally unnecessary --He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's not Army, it's not official --Then it's unofficial.
You think he did it?No --
What do you think?It's too neat.
We know.I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...The army kicked you out for drugs...
Great, great. That's fantastic.It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.That's great.
Jesus, kid. Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?Yes!
Yes!I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.Who is she? Where does she live?
Who is she? Where does she live?Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Didn't kill anything, did I?A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.That would explain the indigestion.
Thank you.Good luck, kid.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?Edward Bloom.
Bloom like a flower?Yes.
Yes.Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
You were expecting me?Not yet.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.It truly is.
I have to leave. Tonight.Why?
You won't find a better place!I don't expect to.
Or are you too scared?I'll go in right now and get that eye.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.Then do it.
Then do it.Fine, I will.

What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Will.Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. My wife, Josephine.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. My wife, Josephine.A pleasure.
Can I see him?Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
How long have you known my father?Thirty years. Maybe more.
Thirty years. Maybe more.How would you describe him?
How would you describe him?Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension. How would his son describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?No.
Did you see that woman?What did she look like?
What did she look like?Well, she... uh...
Well, she... uh...Was she nekkid?
Yeah.It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
How old are you?Eighteen.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Promise me you'll come back.I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
You must be Edward Bloom.How did you know?
Helping people makes me happy.I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different. You married.I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.I see. I thank you for your time.
It's okay, just leave it.I can get it. I can just...
Lord, I'm sorry I...Please. Go. Just go.
Please. Go. Just go.I'll...
I'll...Go.
Lucky girl.I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Hi. How are you feeling?I was dreaming.
I was dreaming.What were you dreaming about?
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.No, I understand.
No, I understand.He was slipping her a little extra cream.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.Stop.
Stop.They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Spooning the sherbet.Can I take your picture?
Can I take your picture?You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.Please?
Oh, so this is a tall tale?Well, it's not a short one.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
There was one time when I was eleven...You were talking about your wedding.
I like your stories.And I like you.
What's your name, Giant?Karl.
Okay.Okay.
What did she say?Beats me.
You're not trying to run away?Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Jesus Christ.Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
The one about the witch.Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.I'm not scared.
You -- -- are in for a surprise.Am I?
You think I'm up for it?You learned from the best.
Really.Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.The Old Lady by the swamp.
The Old Lady by the swamp.She was a witch.
She was a witch.No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.So how does it happen?
So how does it happen?Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
What did he say?You owe me three-fifty.
You owe me three-fifty.Really.
Really.True story.
When did you ever work in an office?There's a lot you don't know about me.
There's a lot you don't know about me.You're right.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.You mean, while I'm here.
You mean, while I'm here.I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...I will.
I will.You know where the chemicals are?
Why not religion, Dad?It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.Oh, so you know.
Did I ever tell you about how...Yes.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.I think someone hasn't.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...Dad?
Dad?Son?
Son?Can we talk?
Dad!What?
What?I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
You think I'm fake.Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river.The river?
Tell me how it happens.How what happens?
How what happens?How I go.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.Like this.
Like this.Okay. Okay.
Let's get out of here.Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Where are we headed?You say...
You say...The River!
It's unbelievable.Story of my life.
Daffodils?They're your favorite flower.
They're your favorite flower.How did you get so many?
You don't even know me.I have the rest of my life to find out.
How can I convince you to stop?Go out with me.
Wait! I need those!There is no softer ground than town.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.Really.
Really.There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
This is why you don't show work in progress.Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?I can't imagine any place better than here.
So what are you up to now?I'm robbing this place.
This is it? The whole vault.'Fraid so.
'Fraid so.Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Oh. Oh.Hello.
Hello.I wasn't expecting you.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --Yes.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.We'll have to pick up a copy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.I'll help you.
I'm going to check on him.I need to lie down for a bit.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Do you like it, being pregnant?I do.
It's bad.It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.You need to go.
You need to go.Probably tonight.
I'm going with you.You don't have to.
You don't have to.I'm going with you.
I talked with your father last night.Did you?
You never told me how your parents met.They met at Auburn.
That's because most of it never happened.But it's romantic.
Mmm.Mmm, what?
Mmm, what?Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Do you love your father?Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.Do you love him?
But it's not true.What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
You're not.I need you on my side.
I need you on my side.I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
What happened?Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.Is he going to be okay?
How did you get here?We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.

Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.We rented a car.
We rented a car.You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?He's up with your father.
How much time does he have left?You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?Of course.
Of course.What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?Yes.
Would you say you understand Josephine?Yes. But that's a different...
Was she one of your teachers?No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.Do you know who that is?
That really happened?Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Is he awake?He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Mom?Yes?
So you never bought any land.Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.That's okay?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?Yes. Thank you.
You first.Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
What for?You know what for.

Alright. How much you need, ho?The hell you call me?

Charlie, don't do anything. Promise me?What?
Frank Abolofia.The Wolf?
Some party.Maybe we should do something?
Maybe we should do something?Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.

Nick, have I been a good partner?Number five with a bullet.
Go to sleep, Charlie.You didn't take, did you...? You hear things.

Getting very weird.I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.Maybe we should bail?
It's incredible. Hit him or something.I don't think he'd feel it.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Squid?Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Joyce can be nice.What'd she say?
What'd she say?That I should let you pay for the drinks. Kampai.

Louder, pal, louder.Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Think we'll get him, Nick?We can't lose.
We can't lose.How can you be so sure?
Don't give him any more.He gets as much as he wants.
